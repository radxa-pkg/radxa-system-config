            ANGLE is catastrophically broken, see:

               https://issues.angleproject.org/u/1/issues/431097618

            This broken codepath is exposed when skia detects vendor
            freedreno (as well as closed mali/img/adreno drivers.. maybe
            the issue will actually get fixed when a new enough skia+
            ANGLE hits the closed drivers on android).

            Workaround the issue by spoofing the vendor string so
            skia doesn't pick the broken ANGLE codepath.  Other
            electron apps will have the same problem, and should be
            listed here as well.
